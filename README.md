# pharyngeal_muscle_model
C. elegans pharyngeal muscle cell (pm3) model, capable of generating Ca2+ slow action potential (NEURON, NMODL).

please run "_run.hoc" to simulate C. elegans pharyngeal muscle cell pm3 slow Ca2+ action potential.
Visualization of what should be found in _log.txt after successful work of the program can be found in "output visualization - v(t) etc.xlsx"
